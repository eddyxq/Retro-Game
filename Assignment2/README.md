# CPSC 599.82 - Assignment 2

We have created several different algorithms in an iterative process. We've classified them into three different categories:

- Best Solutions
- Better Solutions, and
- Tests

***note:** we have set up our scripts to generate a random seed each time they are ran*

## Best Solutions
These algorithms are our attempt at creating a *best solution* as described in the assignment.

    backtracking.py
    pcg2.py

## Better Solutions
These ones are earlier algorithms that work but aren't the best.

    pcg.py
    k1.py
    jacobPCG.py
    random_walk.py

## Tests
These files were for testing and experimenting.

    test1.s
    test2.s
